# Deploying-Application-on-Evmos
To deploy your application on Evmos, which is a blockchain platform compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), you can follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Set up a development environment:
   - Install Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download and install it from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org).
   - Install Git: If you don't have Git installed, download and install it from the official Git website (https://git-scm.com).

2. Clone the Evmos repository:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Use the following command to clone the Evmos repository:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/tharsis/evmos.git
     ```

3. Build the Evmos source code:
   - Navigate to the cloned Evmos directory:
     ```
     cd evmos
     ```
   - Run the build command to build the Evmos source code:
     ```
     make build
     ```

4. Start the Evmos node:
   - Run the following command to start the Evmos node:
     ```
     make start
     ```
   - This command will start a local Evmos node connected to the Evmos test network.

5. Connect to the Evmos network:
   - Open a new terminal or command prompt.
   - Use the following command to connect to the Evmos network:
     ```
     make attach
     ```
   - This command will establish a connection to the running Evmos node.

6. Deploy your smart contract:
   - Write your smart contract code in Solidity and save it in a `.sol` file.
   - Compile your Solidity smart contract using a Solidity compiler like `solc`. You can use online Solidity compilers or install `solc` locally.
   - In the Evmos console, use the `eth.compile.solidity` command to compile your Solidity smart contract. For example:
     ```
     eth.compile.solidity("<Your Solidity code>")
     ```
   - This command will return the compiled contract bytecode and ABI.

7. Deploy the contract:
   - In the Evmos console, use the `eth.contract.deploy` command to deploy your contract. You need to provide the compiled contract bytecode and ABI. For example:
     ```
     eth.contract.deploy("<Compiled bytecode>", "<ABI>")
     ```
   - This command will deploy your contract to the Evmos network and return the contract address.

8. Interact with your deployed contract:
   - Once your contract is deployed, you can interact with it using the contract address and its ABI.
   - Use the `eth.contract.at` command in the Evmos console to create an instance of your deployed contract. For example:
     ```
     const contractInstance = eth.contract.at("<Contract address>", "<ABI>")
     ```
   - Now, you can call functions on the `contractInstance` and interact with your deployed contract.

These steps outline a basic process for deploying your application on Evmos. It's worth noting that Evmos is an open-source project, and the development process may evolve over time. It's recommended to refer to the official Evmos documentation or community resources for the most up-to-date instructions and best practices.
